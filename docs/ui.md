The package contains all **rsg-components** from [react-styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) in their Bootstrap Styled version.

`StyleGuideRenderer` is the global layout component, other components are not described in details here. 

They can be used to create new documentation layout for Bootstrap Styled.

```js
const fa = require('$PACKAGE_NAME/lib/fontawesome.config.js');
console.log(fa);
<div>{fa.toString()}</div>
```
